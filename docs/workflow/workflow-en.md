# Digitization Workflow

There are 4 roles on the BUDA digitization staff for Tibetan material:

*   the **DPE** (Digital Preservation Entrepreneurs)
*   the **FR** (Field Representatives)
*   the **DPM** (Digitization Project Manager)
*   the **DAM** (Digital Archive Manager)

Starting in July of 2017, the workflow is divided into 5 broad processes:

1.  **Finding Opportunities** - The DPE looks for acquisition opportunities.

2.  **Selection and Digitization** - The DPE identifies potential acquisitions and confirms they are needed by 1) consulting the mobile app or 2) consulting the FR. The DPE then digitizes them, does the QC1 (1st Quality Control), and submits the images to the FR.

3.  **Quality Control and Processing** - The FR does the QC2 (2nd Quality Control), post-processes them, then submits the Access Files (web images) with a metada report to the DPM.

4.  **Quality Assurance** - The DPM performs a QA (Quality Assurance) assessment, submits the files to the DAM, and confirms that the DPE can be paid for the work.

5.  **Archiving and Publishing** - The DAM reviews the Access files catalogued by the librarians and then publishes them. The librarians can now create metadata, such as structural or semantic outlines. Every quarter, the DPM collects Master Files (archive images) and submits them to the DAM for archiving.

The same workflow can also be described according to the industry standard digization processes:

## 1\. Selection of materials

*   The FR finds a digitization opportunity and assigns a project to a DPE. The DPE travels to where the collection is located.
*   Most of the time, some of the materials in the collection have already been scanned. As a result, the DPE determines whether the material needs to be scanned or not by consulting the BDRC mobile app.
    *   The DPE inputs the cover title of a work in the app, if the title exists the cover image and/or the publication information are checked to make sure it is the same edition.
    *   Exact photocopies or exact re-prints of a work aren't selected.
    *   When the cover title isn't found, the DPE searches alternative titles in the app. These are found in 1) the inner cover, 2) the beginning of the text, 3) the colophon. The DPE should also consult the owner of the collection or the local librarian.
    *   The DPE selects items that have been digitized previously but that are flagged for re-scanning based on the quality of the digitized file.
*   Works that aren't connect to Buddhism or the Buddhist traditional culture aren't selected.
*   Example: the Tibetan translation of "Visual C++ for beginers", or any material containing ａｎｔｉ－political content.
*   When files that were digitized by a third-party are available, the DPE should consult the FR before acquiring them. In case the image format and the image quality don't comply to BUDA's requirements, both the head librarian and the DPM should be consulted and confirm the acquisition. This is delt with on a case by case basis.

## 2\. Condition evaluation

*   Objects are pulled and reviewed by DPE to determine whether or not digitization is safe with the paper-feed scanner (Fujitsu fi series). If the objects can't be scanned with a paper-feed scanner, the DPE can decide to use a overhead scanner or a camera.

## 3\. Cataloging

*   Works that haven't been cataloged are given an "Accession Number" -- a temporary unique identifier that will be replaced once the work is cataloged by a librarian. For example, in the accession number DE0012, D represents the FR, E represents a DPE from their team, and 12 is the 12th work that was digitized by that DPE. Note that 4 digits have to be use, so 12 is written 0012.
*   The DPE uses the "bibliographic information sheet" to record information for future cataloging. This includes:
    *   authorship
    *   long and short title
    *   number of volumes
    *   extent of each volume
    *   basic publication information

## 4\. Metadata creation

*   Objects that are ready for digitization are reviewed and named with a specific digital filename. The filename is recorded into the bibliographic information form with the corresponding call number, unique data about the item, and information about the digitization including: what date it was scanned, who scanned it, and what equipment scanned it.

## 5\. Production scheduling

*   The digitization process is largely handled by one person, the DPE.
*   Once a group of objects are pulled, the DPE names it, digitizes it, and performs a quality review at time of scanning.
*   Subsequent processes such as file naming, subsequent quality review, derivative making, and submitting are done by the FR.

## 6\. Digitization prep

*   Loose pages in the traditional "pecha" or "poti" format are checked for 1) missing pages and 2) mixed-up pages. Re-organizing pages is easier and faster to do with the physical pages prior to scanning, and the DPE shouldn't underestimate this when it comes to minimizing post-processing tasks.
*   The DPE first checks whether the material they have in hand is part of another work, such as a collected work, or a series. Collections that are split apart won't be accepted.
*   When digitizing "choga" ritual texts, the DPE consults the chant master or a priest familiar with the material to ensure the pages are in the right order. The order of this type of material should be kept as instructed by the priest, even if it doesn't follow the page number sequence, and contains extra inserted pages.
*   Pechas printed on traditional paper are cleaned before being processed in order to minimize the damage small stones and dust can cause to the bulb of the scanner.
*   When using a camera or an overhead scanner the DPE makes sure the lighting is consistent throughout the surface of the material, and that it doesn't change between the beginning and the end of the digitization process.
*   Once a day, preferably at the begining of the first digitization session, the DPE scans a test page to make sure the images don't contain scanning artifacts, such as scanning lines when using a paper-feed scanner, or poorly lit areas when using a camera.

## 7\. Digitization

*   The DPE creates a folder structure ready to receive the images.
    *   folders containing multi-volume works are structured the following way:
        *   AB0012 (work accession number)
            *   01 (vol. 1)
                *   0001.j2k
                *   0002.j2k
                *   ...
            *   02 (vol. 2)
            *   ...
*   The DPE measures the length and width of the material, adds it to 1) the "bibliographic information sheet" and 2) the scanner settings.
*   The scanner settings are adjusted for the current work. This includes:
    *   the target folder
    *   page numbering
    *   image format, DPI, and color space
    *   paper length and width
    *   data quality

## 8\. Post processing

*   The DPE performs the CQ1 using the Image Inspection Checklist.
*   Images are re-scanned or re-ordered until the work complies with the standards.
*   Post-processing includes cropping and de-skewing.
*   The ability to read information accurately and in the way that the original is represented is the main concern here.
*   When cover pages aren't scanned with the paper-feed scanner, 1) the image format, 2) the image height in pixels, and 3) the canvas width in pixels are adjusted to match the other images.

## 9\. Quality review

*   The images are submitted to the FR who performs the QC2, using the Image Inspection Checklist.
*   The FR generates Access Files (web images), uploads them together with the "bibliographic information sheet," and shares it with the DPM
*   The DPM performs the QA (Quality Assurance) review and signs off the work.
    *   all images are reviewed as thumbnails
    *   10% of the images are reviewed at full resolution

## 10\. Archiving

*   Archiving digitized material is done by the DAM, the Digital Archive Manager. Images will be scanned to a staff-member’s portable hard drive.
*   Images are also copied to the staff-member’s computer.
*   As both an extra back-up copy and also an access copy, the images are copied to the Library’s processing space.
*   Because little processing has been done to the images, the processed version of the scanned image is an archival copy.
*   The un-processed version is saved until the processed image is reviewed and published.

## 11\. Publishing

*   Different versions and file types of the same image are created in order to be accessible to all patrons and users.
    *   These derivatives include thumbnail JPEG, TIFF, and GIF.
    *   Only the processed copy (with minor adjustments, and combined when necessary) is published.
